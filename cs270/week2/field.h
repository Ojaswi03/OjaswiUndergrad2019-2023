 * field.h - simple field manipulation functions to get students working
 *           with masking. This will be used in the simulator to extract
 *           information when executing an LC3 instruction. It may also be
 *           used in the assembler to "create" the 16 bit LC3 instructions.
 *           If an assignment involving floating point manipulation (e.g.
 *           16 bit floating point addition), this file can be used to
 *           provide support routines for extracting/setting the sign,
 *           exponent, and mantissa fields.

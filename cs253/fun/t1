#Gene Drive Technology

#The concept of using gene drives was originally developed in the 1960s, which is a type of genetic engineering technique that can modify genes or alleles via a self-propagating mechanism by which desired genetic variants can be spread through a specific organism or population. This method of genetic engineering has been considered to be much faster and more efficient than the typical rules of Mendelian heredity and is also able to override natural selection. Another way to explain this is that they can increase the likelihood that a particular set of genes will be passed onto the next generation, thus allowing said genes to spread through a population.
#           The introduction of CRISPR-Cas9, which was developed in 2012, has been able to greatly enhance the use of gene drives. How it works on the molecular level is that an endonuclease (Cas9) can cleave the DNA (homologous chromosome) at a specific targeted site, which would thus trigger the cell to repair the double-stranded cut. The repair process can then be exploited to make genomic changed at the target site. As such, CRISPR components are incorporated into a “drive allele”, which are copied into the wild type chromosome after DNA repair, thus replacing the wild type DNA sequence at the targeted site of the genome. In short, this process can turn an organism that is heterozygous for a specific allele to become homozygous. By becoming homozygous, the organism thus has a much higher chance of passing down the specific allele to the next generation, and as mentioned previously will be able to spread through a population. Comparing this to a heterozygous organism only allows for a 50% chance for passing down a specific allele to the next generation.
#           Because of this, there are many applications for this technology; It can be used to effectively confer both disadvantageous and advantageous traits. As such, gene drives have the potential to solve a variety of global issues, including the genetic manipulation of parasites and/or vectors for disease control (eradication of certain disease vectors such as malaria-carrying mosquitoes), controlling invasive species of plants, insects, or mammals, and combatting pesticide resistance.
#           When it comes to the eradication of the malaria parasite through the use of gene drive technology to alter mosquitoes (vectors carrying malaria) genetics, there are both positive reasons to do so, but also negative or more ethical reasons to consider before doing so. To achieve the eradication or the reduction of harm (to where it is no longer a public health concern) of malaria is to reduce or eliminate the mosquito population or to render them less competent for pathogen transmission via the use of the gene drive.
#First, the scientist must consider the ethical implications of using gene drives to achieve these goals, which require tight control, which is far from becoming reality and will likely take many years (or decades) to perfect.
#Altering a gene through gene drive technology has a vast number of benefits for the public health of humans. Besides the possibility of eradicating malaria, it can also have the potential to fight many other pathologies and diseases. However, by using this technology, many unknown and undesirable consequences may occur.
#Altering a gene in a specific species (such as mosquitoes) has the potential to give rise to new and unknown animal and human diseases, which in my opinion are next to impossible to accurately predict at this point. Assume for a moment that gene drive is successful in reducing the pathogenicity of the malaria virus of the mosquito population. If this is successful, how would accidental exposure (besides from a mosquito bite), such as inhalation or ingestion affect humans? How could we know or predict if this would result in no harm to humans? Could the modified genes in the mosquitoes be transferred to humans through such means, and if so, what effect could this cause? All these questions give rise to the ethical implications of gene editing and the science is not quite there to have an answer to any of them.
#There are other ethical implications to consider besides human public health. Now, if we assume that gene drive technology is successful in the complete elimination of the mosquito population, this could very well disrupt biodiversity and the ecosystem surrounding the (previously present) mosquito population, having a variety of unknown consequences. Gene editing through gene drive technology could very well both reduce biodiversity and damage the ecosystems in unknown ways. How do we as humans determine whether this is an acceptable consequence? How could we even know or accurately determine how much of an impact gene editing could have on the ecosystem? Furthermore, how far do we have the right to impact the modification or removal of a specific species? All these questions remained unanswered, and in my opinion must be truly considered, because outside of human public health, the ecosystem of the animal kingdom is crucial for our survival.
#Furthermore, even if the science is there to answer all the above questions and to safely and ethically modify the genes of the mosquito population to eradicate the malaria virus, there is one other thing to consider. If we are successful in eradication malaria through gene editing, how could we make sure that this technology would not be used for other (unethical) reasons/goals? An example is that this technology has the potential for use in bioterrorism. Someone, who has the intent to cause harm to others, could use gene editing to produce new pathogens or diseases with the potential for infection to humans. Furthermore, this technology could also be used to produce new genetic disorders as well, rather than just pathogens/diseases that can infect an individual. There are so many unknown possibilities, in which this technology can be used as a weapon. Because of this potential threat, the question arises as to how would research in gene drive/gene editing be conducted? How would scientists and governments make sure that the technology/science behind gene editing is kept safe, away from possible bioterrorists? Again, many questions remain unanswered and there are so many threats and ethical considerations to consider regarding this technology.
#All of the above, possible negative outcomes of this technology are extremely important to consider. To address some of the questions above, I think above all else, the scientific community must conduct research and further developments in this field very cautiously. Gene editing should only proceed when their side effect and possible societal and ecological impacts are sufficiently understood or known. In addition, I believe there must be some type of worldwide ethical board with the specific purpose to govern and oversee the research behind gene drive/CRISPR-Cas9. UNESCO may come to mind, but they are more of a general governing board in all matters educational, scientific, and cultural. Perhaps a subdivision within UNESCO should be created specifically to focus on gene drive/CRISPR-Cas9 research and development.
#In addition, to cautiously pursue research/development only when the impacts are sufficiently understood or known, the information surrounding such research/development should not be made public. In my opinion, only specific scientists/governments should be allowed to conduct the research, with the intended goal of malaria eradication (and possibly eradication of other pathogens in the future). This is to avoid the possibility of bioterrorists using the technology as a weapon to cause harm to not only other human beings around the world, but also to animals, the ecosystem, and thus the Earth itself.
#In light of all these ethical considerations, the scientific community, in conjunction with some type of ethical governing board (as mentioned previously), must decide whether the positive out ways the potential negative impacts of using this technology. In addition, those that are most heavily affected by malaria (Africans) should be included in the discussion and decision-making (upon being informed). Although this technology has given us more hope for the future in fighting diseases such as malaria, it has also raised many fears, in which potential negative outcomes are possible.
#That being said, in my opinion, we should continue to pursue research/development surrounding the gene drive/CRISPR-Cas9 technology. However as mentioned previously, we must be extremely cautious in doing so, only further research when all possible negative impacts are fully understood or with the knowledge in how to prevent or avoid them, including making the research not accessible to the public, as for concern to public safety. In my opinion, more debates need to be conducted around the ethics on this topic and whether it should even be pursued in the first place (regardless that I think it should). Even if scientists/governments around the world agree to continue research/development, we are likely decades away from being able to pursue this technology ethically, being able to prevent harm, and allow for the eradication of diseases such as malaria.

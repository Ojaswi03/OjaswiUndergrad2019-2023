#exp1: delete[] not used.

#exp2:  Delete[] not used. index in an array starts from 0-9 for size =10 therefore, since there is no index 10 in the 
#	    array thus giving an error.There are 0 bytes after index 9 in the array.

#exp3: X is never initialized.

#exp4: We never initialized y with any and value in the beginning and we don't go for the if condition since "now" 
#	   will not be equal to zero ever. 

#exp5: An index which is not present in the array was called which was out of range for the initialized array.

#exp6: delete[] was called before using the function hence giving an error.

#exp7: delete[] should be called at line 3 but "delete" is being called here.

#exp8: free() only clears the memory it doesn't delete the data therefore delete[] should be called here.

#exp9: 'a' is acting as pointer to an address for it know hat is to be incremented. 'a' itslef doesn't address 
#	to anything.

#exp10: Since diff is given an unsigned data type,smaller - bigger number will give the difference but will ignore 
#	the signs. This can be overcomed by removing the 'unsigned' from diff or just going for bigger number - smaller 
#	number and then later adding the '-' sign.

        // the speed unchanged.
	
	//create a constructor that takes in a String for the name and an int for the topSpeed
	//use only the setters initialize the instance variables


        //create an equals(Object other) method that returns True if the two Animal objects have 
	//top speeds that are within 2 mph of each other
	
	// Create a toString method
	// Formatting of the returned String should follow this example:
	// Name: elephant     Top Speed: 25
